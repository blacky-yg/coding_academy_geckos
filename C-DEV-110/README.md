# C-DEV-110

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those who practice the methodology use different sets of tools—referred to as "toolchains"—rather than a single one. These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process:

    - Coding – code development and review, source code management tools, code merging
    - Building – continuous integration tools, build status
    - Testing – continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks
    - Packaging – artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
    - Releasing – change management, release approvals, release automation
    - Configuring – infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools
    - Monitoring – applications performance monitoring, end-user experience

Some categories are more essential in a DevOps toolchain than others; especially continuous integration (e.g. Jenkins, Gitlab, Bitbucket pipelines) and infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, Puppet).
